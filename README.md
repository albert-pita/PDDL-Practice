# PDDL-Practice

PDDL Practice - IA - Spring 2019/20

In this repository there is the third practice of the subject IA about Planification.

In the Documentation.pdf file you can find all the documentation made throughout the project. It explains all the decisions made, all the experiments done and the results obtained. It is written in Spanish.

In the folder PDDL you will find all the source code. There are several extensions of the main problem. To compile and run the basic, first and second extensions you will have to use the FFv2.3, and for the third and fourth the MetricFF.

In the folder Generador you will find an automatic problem generator that can create random problems for every extension. There is a README there to know how to compile it and use it. It could be improved and made more readable but it works.
